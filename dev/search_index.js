However, the point of discussion is to form one's own opinion instead of following someone's idea. Don't copy the homework.\nCopied homework will get no points. That is, we will use a very one-sided rule. If two homework looks very similar, both of them get zero points.\nCopied homework from the internet is also disallowed. If the homework looks similar to any online resources: solution manual or anything, the homework will also get zero points.\nI will put the pdf file of the homework on google classroom. The pdf file will specify the due date of the homework. One-day delay is allowed (By Friday 5 pm). If you need more time to finish the homework, please send an email to me and explain why you need an extension and when you expect to turn in your homework. Late homework(within a week) without reasoning gets 70% of the scores. Late homework without reasoning for more than a week will get 0 points.\nThe purpose of homework is to help you learn the subject. Please give yourself some time to think independently first, then discuss with your classmates or TA. TA has no responsibility to do the homework for you. Please start doing the homework early.","category":"page"},{"location":"syllabus/#Textbook","page":"Syllabus","title":"Textbook","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"syllabus/","page":"Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","text":"None","category":"page"},{"location":"syllabus/#Prerequisites","page":"Syllabus","title":"Prerequisites","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"syllabus/","page":"Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","text":"Basic knowledge in statistical mechanics (I)","category":"page"},{"location":"syllabus/#Course-Description","page":"Syllabus","title":"Course Description","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"syllabus/","page":"Syllabus","title":"Syllabus","text":"Statistical mechanics (II) will focus on interacting effects in the many-body system. The course will cover topics beyond Statistical mechanics (I) and focus on different phases of matter beyond equilibrium interacting-free systems. The course will start with the discussion of phases of matter using the Ginsburg-Landau theory. After introducing the Ginsburg-Landau theory, we will introduce the spirit and the physical meaning of the renormalization group. Equipped with the renormalization group technique, we will revisit the phases of matter in Fermionic/ Bosonic systems and discuss exotic phases of matter beyond the conventional Ginsburg-Landau paradigm.
